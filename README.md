## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m a data scientist focused on building deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. This repository is where I document and share my work on a variety of deep learning tasks, from image classification and natural language processing to time series forecasting and generative models.

My work centers around designing and experimenting with different model architectures, including CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and custom hybrid models depending on the problem domain. I prioritize model interpretability and modularity, so each architecture is broken into reusable components that can be easily adjusted or extended for new tasks.

I also spend a lot of time on optimization techniquesâ€”not just tuning hyperparameters, but also refining training loops, experimenting with learning rate schedules, applying regularization strategies, and using tools like early stopping and checkpointing to improve training stability and generalization. I often include training diagnostics like TensorBoard visualizations to monitor performance over time.

Each project in this repository follows a structured workflow, typically including stages for data preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and inference. I try to keep the code clean, reproducible, and well-documented. Where possible, I include notebooks for exploration and experimentation, along with Python scripts for production training runs.

This repo reflects how I work in real-world deep learning projects: combining theoretical understanding with practical workflows, staying focused on results while maintaining clarity and reproducibility. Whether youâ€™re exploring deep learning for the first time or looking for templates to build on, I hope this collection is helpful.
